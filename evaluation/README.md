Each location is home to a specific task

Your goal is to find a flag based on the description of the task.

>   Flags look like this `CTF{something_inside}`

Some tasks require you to work with some files which are included in an attachment.

>   In case you are working from within the telnet server, please clone this repository and access the attachments [here](#attachments)

Once you have found the flag, submit it to capture the location.

If you are stuck at a question, you can request for a hint.

Note that all hints have a penalty that reduces your score.

## Rules

*   You may use the internet for help
*   You must not cooperate with other participants
